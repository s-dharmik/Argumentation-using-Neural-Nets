# Argumentation using Neural Network
- These code files are displaying implementation of Argument Mining and Argument Assessment for filtering arguments using data pre-processing and implementing ML model(SVM model) for it.  
- Used ML methods like TF-IDF and token vectorization used for Data Pre Processing, SVM used for Higher accuracy besides other ML models. ‚úçüèª
